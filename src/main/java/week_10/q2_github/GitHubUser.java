            GitHub user's login, their name, and their location.

        TODO Use public fields. Don't use private fields with getters and setters.

        For example, in this response,
        https://api.github.com/users/gvanrossum
        The login is "gvanrossum"
        The name is "Guido van Rossum"
        The location is "San Francisco Bay Area"
